Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 7 Ways  
===

Vis 1: Tableau
===
For my first method of visualization I used Tableau
<img width="800" alt="tableau_no_interaction" src="https://github.com/madelynmarcotte/a2-DataVis-7Ways/assets/51792257/cd534f1b-41bd-4f7b-b915-91c83e866ec2">

I was able to incorporate all of the required elements into my design, as well as adding a chart title and legends to make it clear what kind of data the chart is representing.

Vis 1: Technical Achievement:
===
I incorporated this chart into a dashboard and added filters to allow viewers to sort the data based on certain column attributes.
<img width="787" alt="tableau_filters_inaction" src="https://github.com/madelynmarcotte/a2-DataVis-7Ways/assets/51792257/2091fe9c-2587-4171-bb54-9f81562b3dcb">
This first image shows the dashboard with the filters without activating any of them.

Here you can see the data is being filtered by penguin species.

<img width="788" alt="tableau_filtered_two" src="https://github.com/madelynmarcotte/a2-DataVis-7Ways/assets/51792257/3348c3e0-ca34-4632-bdc2-03a520448195">

In this image, the data is being filtered by penguin bill length.

Overall, I found Tableau to be very straightforward and user friendly. I have experience working with it in the past which definitely contributed to this. I find it to be very helpful when creating interactive charts, which makes sense since it is designed for dashboards. I think that it is one of its strongest uses. 

Vis 2: Flourish
===
For my second vis method I chose Flourish. 

<img width="958" alt="flourish_basic_view" src="https://github.com/madelynmarcotte/a2-DataVis-7Ways/assets/51792257/bead3e2f-2e5a-4503-9a77-c0f1de8ad43b">

I was able to include all of the required components except for changing the size of the points based on the values in the bill length column. 

As someone who has never used Flourish before but has experience with Tableau I found it very easy. It works similarly to tableau in a drag and drop way which made the chart come together very quickly especially compared to some of the other methods. I think it is very good for quick, interactive visualizations.

Vis 2: Technical Achievement:
===
I was also able to add a legend and chart title, as well as a filter for an additional column, which island each penguin is from.

<img width="958" alt="flourish_filter" src="https://github.com/madelynmarcotte/a2-DataVis-7Ways/assets/51792257/4b51e422-07f0-4dfc-9856-8406adb9a25a">

Here you can see the chart filtering the data by which island the penguin is from.

<img width="957" alt="flourish_filter_2" src="https://github.com/madelynmarcotte/a2-DataVis-7Ways/assets/51792257/ceaf1b90-76dc-4063-9328-ce8f660b9240">

Here you can also see that the chart is able to use the legend as a filter as well, and filter the data by penguin species.

<img width="960" alt="flourish_labels" src="https://github.com/madelynmarcotte/a2-DataVis-7Ways/assets/51792257/f1a4b46d-3032-4451-8853-f3fc8f3df941">

The chart also allows for you to hover over each point on the chart and view the island, species, bill length, flipper length, and body mass. 


Vis 3: d3.js
===
For my third visualization I chose d3. 

![d3 scatter plot](https://github.com/madelynmarcotte/a2-DataVis-7Ways/assets/51792257/e92f7e13-e4bf-4b32-a686-160973c52ed5)

I was able to include all of the required design components, and also included a chart title and a legend for the penguin species.

As someone with less JavaScript experience than any other language or tool that I chose, I spent the most time making this chart. After doing assignment 1 though I felt a bit more confident. Through our reflections I have also seen a lot of the potential d3 has for making great visualizations, and that with a bit more practice, I could make some really interesting and dynamic visualizations.

Vis 4: Python + Altair
===
For my fourth visualization I chose to use the Altair library with the Python language. 

![python+altair](https://github.com/madelynmarcotte/a2-DataVis-7Ways/assets/51792257/de452868-3bf2-49b7-8b4c-db1231a751fe)

I was able to include all of the required elements in this visualization, and also added a chart title and legends for both the species and bill length.

I have experience with Python but have never used Altair and overall found it fairly intuitive. With the help of some references I was able to put together my graph fairly quickly and still add additional features like titles and legends. 

Vis 4: Design Achievement
===

For most of the other charts I did not put much thought into the colors that each species represented aside from ensuring that there was sufficient contrast. For this chart I decided to utilize colors often associated with penguins in order to keep the theme consistent throughout the chart, and to evoke the image of penguins as you are looking at it. I think it is a light-hearted way to use color to evoke associations in the viewer. 

Vis 5: Python + Seaborn
===

For my fifth visualization I used Python again, this time with the seaborn library.

![python_seaborns](https://github.com/madelynmarcotte/a2-DataVis-7Ways/assets/51792257/6599ee2d-c81c-46da-bc1b-1ae17d62b4d4)

I was able to include all of the required elements in this visualization, and also added a chart title and legends for both the species and bill length.

Seaborn in Python is a library that I have some experience with, and overall found it simple. I liked that I was able to generate my whole graph with various features in a single line of code, after loading in my data and importing pandas and seaborn. I think that in itself shows how effective it can be to generate charts quickly.

Vis 6: R + ggplot2
===

For my sixth visualization I used the R language with the ggplot2 library. 

<img width="548" alt="r+ggplot2" src="https://github.com/madelynmarcotte/a2-DataVis-7Ways/assets/51792257/5775ca50-7ec8-4bcb-9ba9-965c5ea97b9b">

I was able to include all of the required elements in this visualization without referencing the Professor's provided code. I also included two legends and a chart title as well.

I have used R in the past but have limited experience with ggplot2. Overall I found the process of making this chart to be quick and easy. I think that some of the default settings for this library are more appealing (to me personally at least) than some of the others that required more tweaking to get the right size, shapes, length, etc. I think that sets itself up well to be a versatile plotting tool that can be utilized in many applications.

Vis 7: Python and Pandas
===

For my last visualization I chose to use python with pandas, which is a combination I have lots of experience with for creating dataframes, but less experience with using for plotting, so I thought it would be interesting to compare to the others such as seaborn and altair. I was able to add all of the required components to the graph, but overall felt that Altair had better functionality and opportunities for more interesting features. Pandas works well as a simple baseline, but I think there are other python tools that are better for plotting

Overall Design Achievement
===
Throughout all of the charts I created for this assignment I sought to make the data clear through the use of contrasting colors, informative legends, and chart titles. Without tools to guide the viewer towards knowing what colors or sizes are represented in the data, these features are not important. These features must be use appropriately and with correct labeling and documentation in order to enhance the user's experience rather than hinder it with unexplained information.

Start of original Readme
===

Now that you have successfully made a "visualization" of shapes and lines using d3, your next assignment is to successfully make a *actual visualization*... several times across different tools. 

The goal of this project is to gain experience with as many data visualization libraries, languages, and tools as possible.

I have provided a small dataset about penguins, `penglings.csv`.
Each row contains a penguin observation and several variables about it, including bill length, flipper length, and more.

Your goal is to use 7 different tools to make the following chart:

![](img/ggplot2.png)

These features should be preserved as much as possible in your replication:

- Data positioning: it should be a upward-trending scatterplot as shown.  Flipper Length should be on the x-axis and Body Mass on the y-axis.
- Scales: Note the scales do not start at 0.
- Axis ticks and labels: both axes are labeled and there are tick marks at a reasonable interval, e.g 10, 20, 30, etc.
- Color mapping to species.
- Size mapping to Bill Length.
- Opacity of circles set to 0.8 or similar for a semi-transparent effect.

Other features are not required. This includes:

- The background grid.
- The legends.

Note that some software packages will make it **impossible** to perfectly preserve the above requirements. 
Be sure to note where these deviate as you reflect on what a tool is good for.

Improvements are also welcome as part of Technical and Design achievements.

Libraries, Tools, Languages
---

You are required to use 7 different tools or libraries.
Of the 7 tools, you must use at least 3 libraries (libraries require code of some kind).
This could be `Python, R, Javascript`, or `Java, Javascript, Matlab` or any other combination.
Dedicated tools (i.e. Excel) do not count towards the language requirement.

Otherwise, you should seek tools and libraries to fill out your 7.

Below are a few ideas. Do not limit yourself to this list!
There are new tools coming out every year and we may not have an exhaustive list of the latest and greatest.

Some may be difficult choices, like Matlab or SPSS, which require large installations, licenses, and occasionally difficult UIs.

I have marked a few that are strongly suggested.

- R + ggplot2 `<- definitely worth trying`
- Excel
- d3 `<- since the rest of the class uses this, we're requiring it`
- Altair `<- hugely popular python library. highly recommended `
- three.js `<- well, it's a 3d library. not really recommended, but could be interesting and fun`
- p5js `<- good for playing around. not really a chart lib`
- Tableau
- PowerBI
- Vega-lite <- `<- very interesting formal visualization model; might be the future of the field`
- Flourish <- `<- popular in recent years`
- DataWrapper <- `<- popular in recent years`
- GNUplot `<- the former CS department head uses this all the time :)`
- SAS/SPSS/Matlab

You may write everything from scratch, or start with demo programs from books or the web. 
If you do start with code that you found, please identify the source of the code in your README and, most importantly, make non-trivial changes to the code to make it your own so you really learn what you're doing. 

Tips
---

- If you're using d3, key to this assignment is knowing how to load data.
You will likely use the [`d3.json` or `d3.csv` functions](https://d3js.org/d3-dsv) to load the data you found.

**Beware that these functions are *asynchronous*, meaning it's possible to "build" an empty visualization before the data actually loads. Figuring out how to do this properly can be a major hiccup if you haven't used async functions before. If this means you, start part of this project early so you don't end up in a rush!**

- *For web languages like d3* Don't forget to run a local webserver when you're debugging.
See my a1 video or online tutorials for how to do this.
Being able to host a local webserver is an essential web development skill and very common in visualization design as well.

Readme Requirements
---

A good readme with screenshots and structured documentation is required for this project. 
It should be possible to scroll through your readme to get an overview of all the tools and visualizations you produced.

- Each visualization should start with a top-level heading (e.g. `# d3`)
- Each visualization should include a screenshot. Put these in an `img` folder and link through the readme (markdown command: `![caption](img/<imgname>)`.
- Write a paragraph for each visualization tool you use. What was easy? Difficult? Where could you see the tool being useful in the future? Did you have to use any hacks or data manipulation to get the right chart?

Other Requirements
---

0. Your code should be forked from the GitHub repo.
1. Place all code, Excel sheets, etcetera in a named folder. For example, `r-ggplot, matlab, mathematica, excel` and so on.
2. Your writeup (readme.md in the repo) should also contain the following:

- Description of the Technical achievements you attempted with this visualization.
  - Some ideas include interaction, such as mousing over to see more detail about the point selected.
- Description of the Design achievements you attempted with this visualization.
  - Some ideas include consistent color choice, font choice, element size (e.g. the size of the circles).

GitHub Details
---

- Fork the GitHub Repository. You now have a copy associated with your username.
- Make changes to fulfill the project requirements. 
- To submit, make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) on the original repository.

Grading
---

Grades on a 120 point scale. 
24 points will be based on your Technical and Design achievements, as explained in your readme. 

Make sure you include the files necessary to reproduce your plots.
You should structure these in folders if helpful.
We will choose some at random to run and test.

**NOTE: THE BELOW IS A SAMPLE ENTRY TO GET YOU STARTED ON YOUR README. YOU MAY DELETE THE ABOVE.**

# R + ggplot2 + R Markdown

R is a language primarily focused on statistical computing.
ggplot2 is a popular library for charting in R.
R Markdown is a document format that compiles to HTML or PDF and allows you to include the output of R code directly in the document.

To visualized the cars dataset, I made use of ggplot2's `geom_point()` layer, with aesthetics functions for the color and size.

While it takes time to find the correct documentation, these functions made the effort creating this chart minimal.
