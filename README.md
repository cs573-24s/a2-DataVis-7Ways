Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 7 Ways  
===

# D3

- **D3:** Creating a scatter plot with D3.js involves preparing and loading data into JavaScript, creating an SVG container to hold chart elements, defining scales to map data to pixel positions, drawing scatter points and adding axes, adding interactive behaviors and styling, and optionally adding text labels or legends, followed by testing and deployment. D3.js offers rich functionality and APIs allowing users to create highly customized interactive data visualizations.

# PythonAlt

- **PythonAlt:** Using Altair for data visualization involves loading data into a pandas DataFrame, defining encoding channels such as x, y, color, and size, specifying the desired chart type and properties, and then rendering the plot. Altair simplifies the process by providing a concise and declarative syntax, enabling users to create interactive and visually appealing visualizations with minimal code.

# PythonMatplotlib

- **PPythonMatplotlib:** Matplotlib in Python offers versatile plotting capabilities. Start by importing the library and loading your data. Then, customize your plot with desired features like colors and labels. Finally, display the plot using plt.show().

# R_ggplot2

- **R_ggplot2:** Previously, the visualization was created using ggplot2 in R. The process involved loading the penguins dataset, filtering out rows with missing values, normalizing the bill length, and then plotting the scatter plot with customized aesthetics such as color, size, and axis labels. Annotations were added to denote small and large balls based on bill length. Finally, the plot was displayed using the print() function.
