Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 7 Ways  
===

# R + ggplot2 + R Markdown

* It is quite easy to use if you were familiar with R before because adding an element on the chart is like adding more parameters (Size, Color, Axis).
* Lots of resources from the R community that give some examples and guidance for customizing the chart.
* Compared to Python, the structure code of `ggplot2` is easier to follow.

# d3.js
* Not easy to make a scatter plot in `d3.js` since everything has to be built on modular.
* Need lot of effort to make a chart that similar to `ggplot` R.
* A lot of feature can be custom but the code will be very long compared to simple `ggplot`.
* However, I failed to show the legend of size.

# Python + Seaborn + matplotlib.pyplot
* One of my favourite library to make a scatter plot, similar to `ggplot` R.
* Customization is very easy; the documentation gives very clear guidance, even for beginners.
* There is no way to add interactivity here, just a static chart.

===

# Python + Altair
* Almost similar to `Seaborn` and `matplotlib` with features plus interactivity.
* The code structure is not easy to follow, but the documentation can help.
* More website-friendly than any other Python library to make a chart that interactive.

# Tableau
* Easy to load data since it just drags and drops.
* some limitations on custom the axis, but interactivity is sufficient.
* Quite cumbersome if you need to calculate a new column from existing variables.
* Public Tableau has limited features compared to the Desktop version.

# PowerBI
* Similar to Tableau, but lacks some features.
* The app is sometimes slow (may vary on different laptops) and sometimes crashes.
* The customization on the Size feature is very limited
* Hard to add color to the pane (I can't find the option to add color on the pane).

# Microsoft Excel
* Way to go to make a very simple scatter plot
* There is no way to add a size feature to the chart
* To make the scatter plot I need to make some customization on the data (see the file).

# Flourish
* Very straightforward and easy to use for beginners.
* lots of templates that can be easy to follow and modify.
* The simple animation seems easy to add, like a slider.

# Datawrapper
* Almost similar to `Flourish` in many ways.
* limited features to customize the axis.
* color blind check in the end is unique.
* The animation and interactivity are limited and worse than `Flourish.`

## Technical Achievements
* Try eight different viz tools and learn each behavior to add some animation like tool-tips.
* Learn more about d3, and is quite frustrating.
  
## Design Achievements
* Keep the consistency of color options and scale of the axis, and try to follow the example.
* Try some interactivity features on different tools
