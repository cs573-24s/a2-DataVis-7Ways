Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 7 Ways  
===

## Python Plot 1 -> Matplotlib + Seaborn

I created my first plot using python. 
I employed the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. 
These libraries work very well together and writing the code to output the plot was very straightforward and simple. 
The viz displays the differnt lengths of penguin bills with 5 distinct sized points.


## Python Plot 2 -> Altair

My second plot was created using python.
I employed the Altair library.
I had never used Altair before, but it was not extremely difficult to learn.
I thought this viz looked better than the previous one. 
The points were larger and the clustering was more visually appealing.


## Tableau

My third plot was created using tableau.
It was easy to create the viz using Tableau. 
I was able to change the shape of the datapoints based on the island where each bird was found.
When hovering over a point, the relative information appeared on the screen.


## RStudio -> ggplot2

My fourth plot was created using RStudio.
I employed the ggplot2 library.
The colors I used were different than the example, and they appear slightly smaller.
It was not too hard to create the viz in R.

## Javescript -> d3

My fifth plot was created using d3. 
This was by far the hardest viz to make.
It took me a very long time to be able to display the axes, but once they started to appear it made the rest of the process easier.
It was interesting to see how much code I needed to write to create this relitively simple viz.

## DataWrapper

My sixth plot was created using DataWrapper.
DataWrapper gave me some trouble when I was trying to display both of the legends, but the problem ws resolved. 
For a free online data viz tool, it worked well enough.
Similar to Tableau, I changed the shapes of the data points based on the island the birds were found.

## Flourish

For my seventh and final plot I used Flourish.
Flourish was one of my favorite viz tools that I used for this assignment.
It was very simple and straightforward to use.
I much preferd Flourish over DataWrapper.
I could see myslef using Flourish in the future for quick and easy vizualizations.
