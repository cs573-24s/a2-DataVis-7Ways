# D3 + Javascript

The d3 javascript combo was the first one that I started with. I thought it would be simple since I already had experience with creating something like this, but it really took a lot of time and effort. The graph itself was fine, but I really struggled a lot with the formatting of the page. I kept having issues where the bottom half of the graph was cut off and eventually had to redo the entire layout of the page to make things appear properly. Aside from that however, each feature the graph had to have was very easy to add and only required minor tweaks. I think this tool will be really useful for me, but it will take a lot more experience for me to be good at handling it. One hack that i did take some time on was getting the N/A values to disappear, as they would appear in the corner of the graph; i just had to filter out the N/A values from the dataset at the start. 


# Excel

The next one I used was the built-in excel graphing software to act on the data. Since I am not very experienced with excel, this took me some time. However it was only a matter of looking for the proper columns to highlight and selecting them under the proper conditions, as well as some minor formatting changes; once I had the columns right I was basically finished. I could see the tool being really useful for someone with not too much coding experience, as zero code was required; but I don't think this tool is right for me.

# Tableau

The next one I used was Tableau. I have to say, all the hoops I needed to jump through to install the software, register with a student license, and install were definitely a downgrade on the product. It took me longer to find where i needed to go than to create the actual graph. The graphing itself was pretty easy, once I understood the built in category system it was pretty simple to place all the datapoints in their respective categories and create the graph. I would say this is only for someone who uses tableau extensively; if you want to make one or two graphs, this whole process is not really worth it. Also it didn't require any coding, so those less experienced with code will probably find this easier.

# Vega-Lite

The next one I used was Vega-Lite. This tool was all-around a very good experience. The Lite version was completley web-based, so I didn't have to download anything, and with only a few commands I could generate all of the required data in a pleasing format. Literally the only step that brought me any difficulty was importing the CSV file properly. For someone who just wants to generate a graph or other plot, this is the perfect software to use; it's lightweight, and responds quickly with very few commands.
