#DataWrapper
Datawrapper is a web-based data visualization platform that allows the user create a visualization with data sets without a code. I used this one to develop a vizualization for the given dtatset. I created a scatterplot with it but it has all the types of plots like piechatrs histograms and everything. I find it good for quick visualizations and one can create beautiful visualizations with less effort. It is good for people without experience with code

#Flourish
Just like datawrapper, Flourish is also a non code application where a user can create visua;izations with the available datasets. I used it to create scatter plot. It was great and the use of animations is pretty easy to implement.

#D3+JavaScript
It is a software used to manipulate data to comeup with visualizations. It is more robust and flexible allowing the developer play around with a alot of features that it has. I honestly ddnt utilise it to the maximize it that much in this assignment but I am sure I will use it again because it gives me as a designer some control. I did this scatterplot as a beggining point

#P5JS+JavaScript
It is more like D3 in a sense that it is requires programming skills. However it is different in a way the language is contrsucted. It was my first time using it but i think it is not really difficult in a way it is built like python so it was quite easy to understand. Like i di with D# and JS i just created scatter plot without much effects. I wanted to learn a few more tools and be able to choose later which one i woud stick with in future.

#Python +Plotly
I was fascinated with python and alot of libraries it has. I used a couple of libraries but i liked the Plotyly because it was flexible to use and create the visualizations. I created a scatter plot with it and i loved the output and how good it was to comeuo with it.

#Vega
It was quite easy to use. I was scared to try it but after gathering courage i think it was a best choice. It was easy so i was able to create a scatterplot and make colors as i wanted and it looked good in a short period of time, i surely will use it again

#python+matplotlib
I think this is more interactive that the Plotly. I however did not the quality of visualizations that i did with the library. They were ok but not as appearing in appearance as it was with ploty and other libraries in python. I created a scatter plot and the legend as required.

#R+ggplot
I tried this one because I have never used R and I think it was kind of hard for me to navigate through it but i managed to create a scatterplot and I was really willing to gte to use it because I have noticed on the web that alot of visualizations are done in R and they are very beatiful.

#Technical Achievement 
Having a chance to practice with more that 7 tools (ofcourse some i did not submit as i had errors). I can not really point out some unique features of my designs but I can say the use of video play in one of the visualization as well as the ability of the user having a chance to use a mouse to hover on a graph and the graph being able to hide other data that is not of interest to the user i find it interesteing and can be considered as a technical achievement. 

#Design Achievements
The designs that i have are simple and colour consistance. I used Black, red, and green becuse these are easy to see on black background making it easily readable to the user. I also managed to make the sizes of the circles a little bigger and increase the space between them so that the user is not very clouded looking at the plot. The use of a legend offers quick understanding of the species aagainst their flipper lenght and body mass. This makes the busy user to just look at the legend and the plot and be able to make decision
