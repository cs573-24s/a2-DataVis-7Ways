Steps:

Upload Data:

Go to the Flourish website and start a new project.
Choose a scatter plot template.
Upload CSV data file (penglings.csv) into Flourish.

Set Up Axes:

Assign the 'Flipper Length' variable to the X-axis and 'Body Mass' to the Y-axis within the data tab.
Adjust the axis ranges and intervals in the settings to ensure they do not start at 0 and that they have reasonable intervals.

Configure Points:

Map the 'Species' variable to point colors.
Map the 'Bill Length' variable to the size of the points.
Adjust the point opacity to 0.8 for the semi-transparent effect.
Ensure that the size range for the bill length is noticeable but not overwhelming.

Refine Aesthetics:

Label both axes appropriately with their titles.
Remove or adjust the grid and background settings as per the requirements.
I can choose to hide or display legends based on my preference or requirements.

Publish and Export:

Once the visualization looks correct, I can publish it.
Flourish provides options to export the visualization as an image or embed it into a webpage.
